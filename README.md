## Application Workflow

🔹 User enters a text prompt in the application.  
🔹 The React frontend sends a request to the Node.js backend.  
🔹 The backend communicates with the ClipDrop API to generate the image.  
🔹 The generated image is returned to the frontend.  
🔹 Image data and user information are stored in MongoDB.  
🔹 Users can view their generated images and history.
